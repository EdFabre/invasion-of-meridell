Notes on enemy movement...

- Observe that enemies never move backwards, so after sacking all villages they just chill and do nothing


Invaders always target villages to sack them first, but if there's no village adjacent (even diagonally) to them they'll always attack your army with the same priorities (assume X is the invader) -
3 1 6
4 X 7
5 2 8
(sometimes 345/678 is swapped)

On invader stats, video description (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJCtRCyfVww):
-The larger number in the attack strength colum, from 7 to 19, does not actually factor directly into your fighting. That is explained in the instructions.
-The damage you deal is actually the sum of the number in parenthesis in that column, the dice roll (1-20), and any weapon bonus you have, minus the enemies defense.
-In missions 1-5, the different attackers have different attack and defense stats from each other. It is smart to target the ones with weakest defense first, or if they have the same, the one with strongest attack first.
- In missions 6+, the basic attackers all have identical stats so just try to defeat the ones that may be ganging up on a single troop of yours.
