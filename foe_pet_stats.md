////////Notes from various guides////////
[youtube description]
-In missions 1-5, the different attackers have different attack and defense stats from each other. It is smart to target the ones with weakest defense first, or if they have the same, the one with strongest attack first. [Java clone matches this fine]
- In missions 6+, the basic attackers all have identical stats so just try to defeat the ones that may be ganging up on a single troop of yours. [Java clone matches this fine]

Mission 6
- Note the Meohogs are stronger than when you first faced them, so don't take them lightly but you should start by converting the Meohogs and then the buzzes, when you reach them you'll see why. [Java clone matches this fine]

Mission 8
- Mission 8 was the toughest for me, these Grarrls have high attack and low defence [Java clone does NOT match this]

Mission 9
- Mission 9 is easy just very very long, the Grarrls are back but don't hit nearly as often, however their defence has gotten boosted, shame. [Java clone does NOT match this]

--Mission 6--
-Don't be scared off by the buzz's stats. They don't seem to be able to attack you much at all. The defence is true, however. [Java clone does NOT match this]
