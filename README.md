# invasion-of-meridell
clone of neopet's old game that they [removed](https://clraik.com/forum/showthread.php?30654-Invasion-of-Meridell/page2), rewritten

Things to do in the future:
- Seems buzzes were tanks that barely hit (high defence but low attack), while graarl has high attack but low defence - but in mission 9 the graarl defence gets boosted a bit.

Much appreciation to darkflagrance, the author of the Java clone of this game which helped me get started. See Java_Clone.md for more details on his version.
