# invasion-of-meridell
clone of neopet's old game that they removed, rewritten

Rewrite strategy...
Maybe write it in PHP, as an example of a super simple script
BETTER YET - rewrite it in jquery + html, using html as the database as an example, super simple

Much appreciation to darkflagrance, the author of the Java clone of this game which helped me get started. See Java_Clone.md for more details on his version.
