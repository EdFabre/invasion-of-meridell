### A note on IOM Versions
As I reviewed the guides still available, I noted something unexpected.

There appear to have been multiple iterations of IOM. 

The first version was just what we now call 'wave 1', missing missions 6-10. It seemed to last for only a short time, as it's only mentioned briefly in a single guide.

The second version added 'wave 2', and it's state is best described in [this guide](http://www.neopets.com/~GoldEyeGriffin) - it's divergences from version 3 (the final version) are that it appears Grarrl/Buzz couldn't enchant and block skeith teleport and grundo heal, and as a result moehog/techo couldn't disenchant those enchantments, and thus it made more sense to ditch your weak units (as opposed to version 3, where you virtually always keep your original units). This second version seemed to exist for some time, as I found 2 guides explicitly following it, and a few others that could be pointing to it.

The third version appears to have added the enchantment concept, and made a slight tweak to item spawns. Additionally, I *think* but cannot verify that Grarrl/Buzz stats were changed - instead of being identical, Buzz was changed to strong defense / weak attack, and Grarrl was made strong attack / weak defense. This third version also existed for a while, as it has the most guides describing it.

This clone attempts to match the third version of the game. 

### Old 


clone of neopet's old game that they [removed](https://clraik.com/forum/showthread.php?30654-Invasion-of-Meridell/page2), rewritten

Things to do in the future:
- reset mission may bring back converted units or something? Some kind of glitch. (duplicate by getting to mission 2, then clicking reset mission several times)
- release game with link to github source
- github contains issue for each unknown
- github contains link in readme to reverse engineering app

Much appreciation to darkflagrance, the author of the Java clone of this game which helped me get started. See Java_Clone.md for more details on his version.
