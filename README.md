# invasion-of-meridell
clone of neopet's old game that they [removed](https://clraik.com/forum/showthread.php?30654-Invasion-of-Meridell/page2), rewritten

Things to do in the future:
- There's a healing bonus at the end of each round applied to all pets (noted in the team select screen)
-- "The health of the troops may have received a boost since the last battle.<br><br>" (above Mission: text) 
- add lose condition: How you lose: when the invading Neopets destroy four out of your six villages, or when all of your troops are defeated.
- Once you recover a Lost Item, it is saved forever! It'll never reappear, no matter how many times you restart a level.
- show avatar win after mission 7

Much appreciation to darkflagrance, the author of the Java clone of this game which helped me get started. See Java_Clone.md for more details on his version.
