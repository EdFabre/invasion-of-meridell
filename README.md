# invasion-of-meridell
clone of neopet's old game that they removed, rewritten

Next steps...
- Make characters on the board moveable
    -- Our team
        --- Moving onto an item picks it up (and drops old item)
        --- Moving onto a potion consumes it
        --- Moving onto an enemy attacks it
    -- Enemy
        --- Get movement pattern + attacks in place
Taking a break at this point.

Rewrite strategy...
Maybe write it in PHP, as an example of a super simple script
BETTER YET - rewrite it in jquery + html, using html as the database as an example, super simple

Much appreciation to darkflagrance, the author of the Java clone of this game which helped me get started. See Java_Clone.md for more details on his version.
