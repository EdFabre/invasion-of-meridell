# invasion-of-meridell
clone of neopet's old game that they [removed](https://clraik.com/forum/showthread.php?30654-Invasion-of-Meridell/page2), rewritten

Things to do in the future:
- reset mission may bring back converted units or something? Some kind of glitch.
- release game with link to github source
- github contains issue for each unknown
- github contains link in readme to reverse engineering app

Much appreciation to darkflagrance, the author of the Java clone of this game which helped me get started. See Java_Clone.md for more details on his version.
